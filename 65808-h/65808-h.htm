<p>The pecan tree must be protected from attack
by the many destructive diseases and insects that
affect it to produce a bountiful nut crop.</p>
<p>The diseases that affect the pecan, especially
those caused by fungi, are rapidly spread throughout
the trees in an orchard in the early spring.
During this season of frequent rains, the spores
of the disease fungi germinate and invade the
young tender tissues of the shoots, leaves and
nuts. Under conditions of prolonged damp
weather, when the humidity remains high, the
disease organisms reproduce at a rapid rate and
cause severe shedding of leaves and nuts.</p>
<p>Pecans are attacked by more than 20 species
of insects that cause damage to leaves, nuts,
twigs, buds, branches and even the bark. The
development of commercial pecan acreages has
provided ideal conditions for the increase in severity
of both disease and insect damage because
of the abundant food supply in a concentrated
planting of pecans. In its natural habitat the
pecan is less subject to the devastations of diseases
and insects.</p>
<p>The many destructive insects and diseases
must be controlled for successful pecan production.
The pecan grower must also understand
the nature and habits of the various disease and
insect pests that threaten his crop and use certain
cultural practices which help to reduce damage
from diseases and insects.</p>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="small"><i>Pecan Diseases and Their Control</i></span></h2>
<p>The diseases which affect the pecan are of
four different types: namely fungus, bacterial,
virus and physiological. The fungus diseases, the
most numerous and widespread, are caused by
small microscopic molds. Approximately 12 different
fungus organisms cause harmful diseases
of the pecan.</p>
<p>The bacterial disease organisms, unlike the
disease producing fungi, are single celled and can
be seen only under a microscope. Bacterial diseases
are fewer and of less economic importance
than fungus diseases.</p>
<p>Virus diseases are caused by extremely small
agents which can be seen only under special ultra-microscopes
such as the electron microscope.
Plant viruses are protein substances, but their
exact nature is unknown.</p>
<p>Physiological disorders (sometimes called
physiological diseases) are caused by a variety of
environmental conditions. A physiological disorder
in a pecan tree may result from infertile
soil, excessive moisture, or the absence or degree
of available nutritional mineral elements to the
growing tree. These various environmental factors
have special adverse effects, manifested by
specific symptoms caused by insufficient levels
of a given nutritional mineral element or elements,
which are easily corrected by supplying
the tree the necessary mineral elements either
through soil application or foliage sprays.</p>
<h3 id="c6">SCAB</h3>
<p>Pecan scab, caused by the fungus <i>Cladosporium
effusum</i> (Wint.) Demaree, is the most destructive
disease of pecans in Texas. The fungus
invades the young rapidly growing shoots and
leaves and later the developing nuts. Severely infected
nuts on highly scab-susceptible varieties
fall or fail to develop, resulting in a total nut
crop loss. Early season defoliation often occurs
in seasons of frequent rains and high humidity
which facilitate the rapid development and spread
of the scab fungus.</p>
<p>The scab fungus overwinters in infected shoots
and in old shucks and leaves in the trees. In the
spring when temperature and moisture conditions
become favorable, the fungus begins to grow in
the shoot lesions, old leaves and shucks, and within
a few days produces great numbers of spores.
These spores are spread by wind and rain to newly
developed leaves where they germinate and invade
the tender tissues, initiating primary infection.
The fungus produces a great abundance of
spores on the surface of these primary infection
sites and spreads throughout the tree and infects
young shoots, leaves and nuts.</p>
<p>On the leaves, primary infection lesions occur
on the lower leaf surfaces and are characteristically
olive brown, somewhat elongated in
shape and vary in size from a barely discernible
dot to lesions one-fourth inch or more in diameter.
Frequently, adjacent lesions coalesce, forming
large very dark lesions. Primary scab lesions
commonly occur on or along the leaflet veins but
often may be found between the veins on the underleaf
surface. On the nuts, scab lesions appear
as small black dots, which are elevated or sunken
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
in older infections. Adjacent lesions on the nuts
may coalesce forming large sunken black lesions,
<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>. When infection is severe, the entire
nut surface is black in appearance, development
is arrested and the nuts drop prematurely.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig1">
<img src="images/p03.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="548" />
<p class="pcap">Figure 1. Scab lesions on leaves and nuts of Delmas variety. Note concave lesions and overall scabby appearance
of severely infected nuts.</p>
</div>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p03a.jpg" id="ncfig1" alt="Figure 1. Infected nuts." width="500" height="553" />
</div>
<p>Pecan varieties vary in their susceptibility to
scab disease. Among the highly susceptible varieties
are: Burkett, Delmas, Schley, Moore, Halbert
and most western varieties. Moneymaker,
Success and Curtis are moderately resistant. Mahan,
Stuart and Desirable varieties are highly
resistant to the scab fungus. However, this character
of resistance varies, depending on the area
of the state, local environmental conditions and
the particular strain of the scab fungus present.</p>
<p>Scab disease development is favored by rainy
periods and cloudy days when the humidity remains
high and leaf surfaces are wet. Under
these conditions, spores of the fungus in contact
with the wet leaf surface of a pecan leaflet or
nut germinate rapidly, invade the tender tissues
and initiate infection within 6 hours. Lesions resulting
from these infection sites, become visible
to the naked eye within 7 to 14 days, depending
on environmental conditions. A period of warm
dry weather after infection occurs may retard
lesion development.</p>
<p><i>Control.</i>&mdash;The control of pecan scab disease
depends primarily on the protection of tender
leaf, nut and shoot surfaces with proper application
of an effective fungicide. A protective
film of fungicide chemical prevents scab fungus
infections by killing the spores immediately after
their germination, thereby preventing invasion of
susceptible tissues. Unfortunately, once the fungus
has invaded the tissues it becomes protected
from chemical attack and produces spores in great
abundance. Therefore, thorough coverage of leaf,
nut and shoot surfaces with a fungicide chemical
must be maintained to prevent secondary infections, (<a class="fn" id="fr_6" href="#fn_6">[6]</a>, <a class="fn" id="fr_10" href="#fn_10">[10]</a>, <a class="fn" id="fr_11" href="#fn_11">[11]</a>).</p>
<p>Sanitation measures, such as removal of old
attached shucks and leaf stems in trees and
plowing or disk harrowing under fallen leaves
and shucks help reduce primary infections. See
spray schedule, <a href="#Page_4">page 4</a>, for scab disease control.</p>
<h3 id="c7">BROWN LEAF SPOT</h3>
<p>The brown leaf spot disease fungus <i>Cercospora
fusca</i> (Heald and Walf) Rand affects only mature
leaves and usually does not appear until the
latter part of May or mid-June. Primary lesions
develop on the lower leaf surfaces as small dots,
which gradually enlarge and become reddish
brown with a grayish cast. The shape of the lesions
may be circular or irregular, especially
where two or more lesions develop adjacent to
one another, <a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>. In seasons favorable for
brown leaf spot development pecan trees may be
completely defoliated within 3 to 4 months if the
disease is not controlled. Most pecan varieties
which are maintained in a vigorous state of
growth are resistant to brown spot disease.</p>
<p><i>Control.</i>&mdash;See spray schedule, <a href="#Page_4">page 4</a>.</p>
<h3 id="c8">VEIN SPOT</h3>
<p>Vein spot disease is caused by the fungus
<i>Gnomonia nerviseda</i>. The symptoms of the disease
are similar to the leaf lesion symptoms of
scab disease, but vein spot disease, unlike scab
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
disease, affects only the leaves. Lesions of vein
spot disease develop on the veins or stems of leaflets
and leaves, are usually less than one-fourth
inch in diameter and are characteristically dark
brown to black. Leaflets and leaf stems which
are severely affected drop, resulting in premature
defoliation.</p>
<p>The fungus lives in fallen leaves over the winter.
The following spring when temperature and
moisture conditions are favorable, spores formed
in special structures called perithecia are forcibly
discharged into the air and carried by wind currents
to the newly formed spring foliage, initiating
primary infections.</p>
<p><i>Control.</i>&mdash;See spray schedule, <a href="#Page_4">page 4</a>.</p>
<h3 id="c9">LEAF BLOTCH</h3>
<p>Leaf blotch disease is caused by the fungus
<i>Mycosphaerella dendroides</i> (Cke.) Demaree and
Cole. The disease occurs mainly in trees of poor
vigor, which may be due to neglect, infertile soil,
rosette or overcrowding. Nursery trees are particularly
susceptible to the disease.</p>
<p>The fungus overwinters in fallen leaves. In
the early spring, large numbers of spores produced
in the old leaves on the ground are carried
by wind currents to the young leaves in the tree,
where they germinate and rapidly invade the tender
leaf tissue.</p>
<p>The disease symptoms first appear on the undersurface
of mature leaves in early summer, as
small olive-green velvety spots. By midsummer
black pimplelike dots become especially noticeable
in the leaf spots after the surface spore masses
have been removed by wind and rain, giving
the diseased areas of the leaves a black, shiny appearance.
When the disease is severe, infected
leaflets are killed, which causes defoliation of the
trees in late summer or early fall and results in
reduced tree vigor and increased susceptibility to
disease and insect attack.</p>
<p><i>Control.</i>&mdash;Leaf blotch disease can be controlled
effectively in the early spring by disking under
old fallen leaves that harbor the fungus pathogen.</p>
<p>In areas where a spray program for the control
of scab disease is carried out, leaf blotch usually
is not a damaging disease. In localities where
leaf blotch disease occurs in the absence of other
pecan diseases, two applications of fungicide will
control the disease effectively. The first spray
should be applied after pollination when the tips
of the nutlets have turned brown and the second
spray application should be made 3 to 4 weeks
later. See spray schedule, <a href="#Page_4">page 4</a>.</p>
<h3 id="c10">CROWN GALL</h3>
<p>Crown gall disease, caused by the bacterium
<i>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</i> (E. F. and Town.)
Conn., often is damaging to pecan trees. Nursery
trees as well as trees in bearing pecan orchards
are susceptible to the disease.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig2">

<p class="pcap">Figure 2. Brown leaf
spot diseased pecan
leaflet showing typical
symptoms. Lesions are
circular to irregular in
shape.</p>
</div>
<p>The development of galls is confined primarily
to larger roots near the base of the tree trunk,
although small roots may become infected and
galls develop on them. The smaller galls are under
the soil surface and cannot be detected unless
the soil is carefully removed from around the
roots, <a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>. Large galls, often 10 to 18 inches
in diameter, develop on larger roots and may protrude
well above the surface of the soil.</p>

<p>Galls on nursery trees develop at or below the

roots.</p>
<p><i>Control.</i>&mdash;All infected nursery trees should be
dug and immediately burned. Crown gall-diseased
orchard trees sometimes can be saved by digging
the soil from around large roots and removing
the exposed galls. Where galls were removed,
the damaged root surfaces should be painted with
a creosote-coal tar mixture (one part creosote to
three parts coal tar) to prevent spread of the
disease<a class="fn" id="fr_9" href="#fn_9">[9]</a>. Cultivation of the soil around the
trunk base of infected trees should be avoided to
prevent root wounds and spreading of the crown
gall pathogen.</p>
<h3 id="c11">DOWNY SPOT</h3>
<p>Downy spot disease, caused by the fungus
<i>Mycosphaerella caryigena</i> (Ell. and Ev.) Damaree
and Cole, attacks all pecan varieties. Only
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
leaves are susceptible to the disease. Primary infection
of new leaves in the spring occurs from
spores produced in specialized fruiting bodies in
old overwintered leaves. The downy spots appear
usually during the summer months on the
lower surfaces of leaflets. The downy character
of the lesions is due to the production by the fungus
of thousands of minute spores on the surface
of each spot. The spores are spread by wind and
rain to adjacent leaves and to neighboring trees.
After spore dissemination is complete, the lesions
visible from both leaf surfaces are one-eighth to
one-fourth inch in diameter and greenish yellow.
Later in the season the lesions turn brown due to
the death of the leaf cells in the diseased area.</p>
<p>Moneymaker and Stuart varieties are most
susceptible to downy spot disease although all pecan
varieties are moderately to slightly susceptible.</p>
<p><i>Control.</i>&mdash;Disk under old fallen leaves in the
early spring before the leafbuds begin to swell.
This practice covers the leaves with soil and prevents
the discharge of spores into the air, thereby
controlling primary infection of new leaves.
In seasons when heavy rains make early spring
disking impossible, downy spot disease can be
controlled by spraying the trees as indicated in
the spray schedule on <a href="#Page_4">page 4</a>.</p>
<h3 id="c12">BUNCH DISEASE</h3>
<p>Although the cause of bunch disease is not
known, evidence indicates it is an infectious disease,
which suggests that the causal agent may
be a virus.</p>
<p>Trees affected with bunch disease show the
bunching symptom, which is due to excessive
growth of slender succulent twigs from lateral
buds that normally remain dormant. In moderately
affected trees one or several branches will
show the &ldquo;bunch&rdquo; growth symptom. Bunching in
severely affected trees may involve all main
branches which produce thick masses of sucker-like
growth and few, if any, nuts.</p>
<p>Observations indicate that the Stuart variety
is the most resistant to bunch disease.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig4">
<img src="images/p04.jpg" alt="" width="650" height="400" />
<p class="pcap">Figure 4. Rosette die-back symptoms of pecan tree
showing severe zinc deficiency.</p>
</div>
<p><i>Control.</i>&mdash;There is no known effective control
for bunch disease. Early detection of the first
symptom of bunch and pruning out of the affected
branch may prevent spread of the disease
throughout the tree. When the tree is severely
affected, and limbs are involved, the tree should
be destroyed to protect nearby healthy trees from
infection.</p>
<p>For propagation purposes, all bud or scion
wood should be taken only from bunch disease-free
trees.</p>
<h3 id="c13">ROSETTE</h3>
<p>Rosette is a nutritional deficiency disease
caused by certain soil conditions which make zinc
unavailable to the pecan tree. All pecan trees
require zinc for growth.</p>
<p>Trees showing the first symptom of zinc deficiency
have yellowed tops. The individual leaflets
when examined are yellowish and mottled.
The next season the foliage may be yellowish and
the leaflets narrowed and crinkled. More severely
affected trees produce foliage which is a
yellowish to reddish-brown overall color, and the
leaflets are very narrow with reddish-brown spots
and may be perforated. Shoots are much shortened
and the leaves are produced in compact
bunches of dense foliage.</p>
<p>Trees affected by rosette for several seasons
have many dead shoots and small branches from
the dying-back of each season&rsquo;s growth, <a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>.
Such trees are greatly stunted, of poor vigor and
produce few, if any, nuts.</p>
<p><i>Control.</i>&mdash;Rosette is controlled readily by applying
zinc sulfate to the tree either as a foliage
spray or in the dry form as a soil application.
Where a disease and insect spray control program
is being carried out, zinc sulfate may be
added to the spray mixture.</p>
<p><b>Foliage spray.</b> Two pounds zinc sulfate (36
percent) per 100 gallons of water.</p>
<p>First application: after pollination when tips
of nutlets turn brown.</p>
<p>Second application: 3 to 4 weeks later.</p>
<p>Third application: 3 to 4 weeks later.</p>
<p><b>Soil application.</b> Application of zinc sulfate to
the soil, particularly in a large orchard is a more
expensive operation, but it provides longer protection
against rosette.</p>
<p>In highly alkaline soils, or soils that readily
fix zinc and make it unavailable to the tree,
foliage spray applications of zinc sulfate are more
economical because of the excessive rates required
to supply available zinc through the soil.</p>
<p>Rate of application of zinc sulfate: Mildly
rosetted trees&mdash;apply 5 pounds zinc sulfate (36
percent) annually for 2 to 3 years. Severely rosetted
trees&mdash;apply 5 to 10 pounds zinc sulfate
(36 percent) annually until rosette symptoms
disappear.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<p>Time and method of application: Apply zinc
sulfate to the soil around trees in late February
or early March. Broadcast zinc sulfate under the
tree from the trunk to several feet beyond the
limb canopy. Disking, harrowing, or any operation
that mixes the zinc sulfate with the soil, is
desirable to prevent washing away and surface
soil fixing of zinc.</p>
<h3 id="c14">LICHENS</h3>
<p>Lichens commonly are found growing on the
branches and trunks of pecan trees, especially in
humid areas and river bottom orchards having
poor air drainage.</p>
<p>Lichens are nonparasitic to the pecan tree,
but merely attach themselves to the bark surfaces.
Lichens grow equally well on rocks, fence
posts, bricks and other objects. There are several
types of lichens that occur on pecan trees,
none of which are damaging except perhaps in
appearance to the trees in cases of extremely
heavy infestations, <a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig5">
<img src="images/p04d.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="382" />
<p class="pcap">Figure 5. Lichens commonly found on the bark of pecan
trees. Left, a fan-shaped type. Right, an erect-branched
type.</p>
</div>
<p><i>Control.</i>&mdash;The occurrence of lichens in trees
regularly sprayed with copper-containing fungicides
is rare.</p>
<h3 id="c15">ARTICULARIA LEAF MOLD</h3>
<p>Articularia leaf mold caused by the fungus
<i>Articularia quercina</i> (PK) Hoehn is a disease of
minor occurrence and importance. The disease
occurs most commonly following rainy periods
and in areas of high relative humidity in the
leaves of trees of poor vigor.</p>
<p>The fungus produces on the lower surfaces of
the leaves a conspicuous growth of white tufts
which contain masses of spores, <a href="#fig6">Figure 6</a>.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig6">
<img src="images/p04e.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="506" />
<p class="pcap">Figure 6. Articularia leaf mold fungus, showing white
tufts on lower leaf surfaces of pecan leaflets.</p>
</div>
<p><i>Control.</i>&mdash;Articularia leaf mold does not occur
in trees or in orchards which have been sprayed
for disease control.</p>
<p>A single application of fungicide such as zineb
at 2 pounds per 100 gallons of water when the
disease is first detected is usually sufficient to
control Articularia leaf mold disease.</p>
<h3 id="c16">PINK MOLD</h3>
<p>Pink mold, <i>Cephalothecium roseum</i> Corda,
usually occurs on nuts infected with the scab fungus.
The pink mold fungus apparently enters the
nuts through scab lesions on the shucks and continues
to produce masses of pink spores on shuck
surfaces until late fall. The fungus sometimes
invades the kernel of thin-shelled pecan varieties
causing &ldquo;pink rot&rdquo; which is characterized by an
oily appearance of the nut shell and a rancid
odor.</p>
<p><i>Control.</i>&mdash;Pink mold rarely occurs on the
shucks of nuts in the absence of scab disease. In
areas where scab disease control is regularly
practiced pink mold is not a problem.</p>
<h3 id="c17">SPANISH AND BALL MOSS</h3>
<p>Spanish moss, <i>Tillandsia usneoides</i>, and Ball
moss, <i>Tillandsia recurvata</i> L., are not parasitic
to the pecan tree and are similar to lichens in
that they both derive their food from the air,
rain or atmospheric moisture.</p>
<p>Neglected orchards in areas of high humidity
or poor air drainage are most troubled with
Spanish moss and Ball moss. When large and excessive
growths of Spanish moss develop in pecan
trees, the shading effect to the leaves is detrimental
to tree vigor, bearing and growth, <a href="#fig7">Figure 7</a>.</p>
<p><i>Control.</i>&mdash;The Spanish moss plant like the pecan
tree requires sunlight for vigorous growth.
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
A pecan tree kept in a vigorous state of growth
produces dense foliage that effectively shades accumulations
of Spanish moss and retards its
growth.</p>
<p>Spanish moss is not a problem in pecan trees
in orchards which are sprayed with fungicide for
disease control. Both Spanish moss and Ball
moss can be controlled by spraying pecan trees
with 6 pounds of lead arsenate per 100 gallons
of water<a class="fn" id="fr_3" href="#fn_3">[3]</a>. Do not allow livestock to graze in
orchards sprayed with lead arsenate.</p>
<h3 id="c18">COTTON ROOT ROT</h3>
<p>Cotton root rot disease is caused by the fungus
<i>Phymatotrichum omnivorum</i> (Shear) Dvgg.,
a soil-inhabiting pathogen that attacks a wide
range of host plants including the pecan.</p>
<p>The roots of the pecan tree are invaded during
the summer when growth of the fungus in
the soil is most active. The infected roots are
killed, disrupting the transportation of water to
the leaves, <a href="#fig8">Figure 8</a>. Trees diseased by cotton
root rot produce yellow foliage, and shedding of
leaflets occurs during dry periods. Diseased trees
usually die 1 to 3 years after becoming infected.</p>

<h2 id="c19"><span class="small"><i>Pecan Insects and Their Control</i></span></h2>
<h3 id="c20">PECAN NUT CASEBEARER</h3>
<p>The pecan nut casebearer, <i>Acrobasis caryae</i>
Grote, is the major pest of pecans in Texas. Early
in the spring, the overwintered generation feeds
first in the buds and then in the developing
shoots, causing them to wilt and die. Succeeding
generations feed on the nuts during the late
spring and summer, <a href="#fig9">Figure 9</a>. Severe infestations
may destroy the entire crop of pecans.</p>
<p>The adult is a light gray moth which is about
one third inch in length. The wings are gray,
and the forewings have a ridge of dark scales
across them about one-third the distance from
the base. The moths fly at night and spend the
day in concealment.</p>
<p>The young larvae are white to pink, but later
become olive gray to green and attain a length
of about one-half inch.</p>
<p>This insect passes the winter as a partially
grown larva in a tiny silken cocoon called a hibernaculum,
which is usually attached to a bud,
<a href="#fig10">Figure 10</a>. In the spring, the larvae feed for a
short time on the buds, after which they tunnel
in the developing shoots until they reach maturity,
<a href="#fig11">Figure 11</a>. Pupation usually occurs in these
burrows, and the moths emerge in late April and
May.</p>
<p>Two or 3 days after the adults emerge, they
deposit eggs on the tips of the nuts, <a href="#fig12">Figure 12</a>.
Each female may deposit from 50 to 150 eggs.
The eggs, which are just visible to the naked eye,
are greenish white when they are deposited but
assume a reddish appearance a few days later.
The first-generation larvae hatch from the eggs
in 4 or 5 days and migrate to the buds below
the nuts to feed. After a day or two, they enter
the nuts, usually at the base, and feed in them,
each larva frequently destroying an entire cluster.
Bits of frass and webbing may be observed
projecting from the injured nuts. Upon reaching
maturity, the larvae pupate in the nuts and
emerge as adults in June and early July.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<div class="img" id="fig9">
<img src="images/p05c.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="305" />
<p class="pcap">Figure 9. Injury to nuts caused by first generation larvae
of the pecan nut casebearer.</p>
</div>
<p>The adults deposit eggs in grooves on the tips
or bases of the nuts. Second-generation larvae
which hatch from these eggs also feed in the
nuts. Less injury is produced by this generation
because the nuts are larger and each larva requires
only one or two nuts to complete its development.
Pupation takes place in the hollowed
out nuts, <a href="#fig13">Figure 13</a>, and the moths emerge from
late July to early September.</p>
<p>A third generation usually follows, but the
shells of the nuts have become hard, and only a
few of them are penetrated by the larvae. Instead,
they feed in the shucks. A number of third-generation
larvae construct hibernacula, while
the remainder pupate and appear as adults,
emerging from late August to October. These
adults deposit eggs, which hatch into fourth-generation
larvae. If nuts are available, their shucks
constitute the principal food of the larvae of this
generation. In the absence of nuts, the larvae
feed on buds and leaf stems. Overwintering hibernacula
are constructed by the partially grown
larvae by the middle of November<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a>.</p>
<p><i>Control.</i>&mdash;The necessity for control of this pest
may be determined by examination of the trees
when the shoots appear in the spring. If a number
of them are wilted, the following control
measures probably will be required.</p>
<p>A spray application should be made when
eggs of the first generation appear on the tips
of the young nuts in late April or May. The period
of egg deposition usually coincides with the
completion of pollination, at which time the tips
of the nuts turn brown. Satisfactory control may
be obtained by using any of several insecticides.
See spray schedule, <a href="#Page_4">page 4</a>.</p>
<p>Ordinarily, only one application of spray is
required to control the nut casebearer. However,
if trees surrounding the treated area are not
sprayed, moths may enter the sprayed area and
a serious infestation of second-generation larvae
may develop. Under these circumstances, a second
spray may be required in June or early July
when second-generation eggs are deposited<a class="fn" href="#fn_6">[6]</a>,
<a class="fn" href="#fn_11">[11]</a>.</p>
<h3 id="c21">HICKORY SHUCKWORM</h3>
<p>The hickory shuckworm, <i>Laspeyresia caryana</i>
(Fitch), frequently causes severe injury to pecans.
In the late summer and fall the shucks
are tunneled out. As a result, the nuts are slower
to mature and the kernels do not develop properly.
The shucks stick to the nuts and fail to
open, thus increasing the difficulty of harvest.</p>
<p>The adult shuckworm is a dark, grayish-black
moth with a wing span of a little over one-half
inch. The larva is white with a light brown
head. It attains a length of three-eighths inch
at maturity.</p>
<p>The winter is passed by the larvae in fallen
pecan or hickory shucks. They pupate in late
winter and emerge as adults during the spring.
The adults deposit eggs principally on hickory
trees on the leaves and young nuts, and the larvae
feed in developing nuts in early summer.</p>
<p>Succeeding generations develop in pecan
shucks. Before pupating, the larvae cut a hole
to the outside, and then spin a cocoon. When the
moth emerges, the empty pupal skin is left projecting
from the hole and can be seen afterward
on the shuck. As many as five generations may
be completed each year before the last generation
larvae go into hibernation.</p>
<p><i>Control.</i>&mdash;No economical chemical control for
the shuckworm has been developed. Cultural
measures will aid in reducing populations. Plowing
during July and August to turn under the infested
shucks is relatively effective. The larvae
are unable to mature in the decaying shucks, and
the adults cannot emerge from the soil. Care
should be taken to completely cover the fallen
shucks, but the depth of plowing should be regulated
or damage to the roots will result.</p>

<h3 id="c22">PECAN WEEVIL</h3>
<p>The pecan weevil, <i>Curculio caryae</i> (Horn), is
a late-season pest of pecans in Texas. In years
when severe infestations occur, this insect may
destroy a large portion of the pecan crop. The
kernels are eaten out by the larvae.</p>
<p>The adult is a brownish weevil which is about
three-eighths inch long. The female has a snout
which is as long as the body; the male&rsquo;s is somewhat
shorter.</p>
<p>The weevil appears in late August and early
September. After the nut kernels have hardened,
the female chews a hole in the shell and deposits
her eggs in little pockets in the nuts. Creamy
white grubs hatch from the eggs and feed inside
the nuts during the fall, attaining a length of
about three-fifths inch. When they reach maturity,
the grubs chew a hole about one-eighth inch
in diameter in the shell, emerge from the nut and
drop to the ground in late fall and early winter.
They burrow in the soil to a depth of 4 to 12
inches and construct a cell. Some individuals remain
in the larval stage until the following fall
when pupation occurs. Other larvae do not transform
to pupae until the succeeding year. The
adults appear during the summer, following pupation.
The entire life cycle requires from 2 to 3
years, most of this time being spent in the soil.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig11">
<img src="images/p06.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="597" />
<p class="pcap">Figure 11. Overwintered larva of the pecan nut casebearer

</div>
<p><i>Control.</i>&mdash;Frequently, certain trees in the orchard
are more heavily infested than others, since
the adults usually do not go far from the tree
upon which they developed. The time at which
insecticide applications should be made to control
this insect can be determined by jarring the
trees. Begin checking the first week in August.
A large sheet should be placed under a tree and
the limbs jarred with a padded pole. The weevils
drop to the ground and remain motionless for a
short period, at which time they may be counted.
When three or more weevils are jarred from each
tree, an application of spray containing 6 pounds
of 50 percent DDT wettable powder per 100 gallons
of water should be made<a class="fn" id="fr_8" href="#fn_8">[8]</a>.</p>

</div>
<h3 id="c23">STINK AND PLANT BUGS</h3>
<p>The adults of several species of stink bugs and
plant bugs suck the sap from young pecan nuts
causing an injury known as black pit, in which
the interior of the nuts turns black. The injured
nuts fall from the trees before the shells harden.</p>
<p>Feeding by the insects after shell hardening,
<a href="#fig14">Figure 14</a>, produces brown or black spots on
the kernels. Areas affected taste bitter, but the
remainder of the kernel is unaffected.</p>
<p>Stink bugs are familiar to everyone. Plant
bugs resemble them and are usually shades of
brown, smaller and narrower in body outline.</p>
<p>Plant bugs and stink bugs overwinter in the
adult stage in debris on the ground. In the
spring, the adults are attracted to growing vegetation
such as cover crops or weeds, where they
deposit their eggs. The immature bugs develop
on low-growing vegetation. When they reach maturity,
their wings are fully developed and they
fly to pecan trees. A few eggs may be deposited
on pecan trees, but the young bugs apparently
are unable to develop on them. Only the adults
are present in sufficient number to inflict economic
injury. There may be as many as four
generations each year.</p>
<p><i>Control.</i>&mdash;Although certain insecticides will
control these pests, the number and frequency of
spray applications necessary for control would
not be economical.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>Care should be taken to keep weeds down in
the orchard during the growing season. Winter
cover crops should be plowed down early in the
spring so they will not be attractive to the adults
coming out of hibernation. If this operation is
delayed, the bugs will leave the cover crop when
it is removed and migrate to the trees in large
numbers.</p>
<h3 id="c24">APHIDS</h3>
<p>These soft-bodied insects appear during the
summer and fall. They suck the sap from the
leaves, causing them to turn yellow or brown and
fall to the ground. Heavy infestations may cause
defoliation in the late summer reducing the nut
crop in the current and succeeding year.</p>
<p>The black pecan aphid, <i>Melanocallis caryaefoliae</i>
(Davis), is about one-sixteenth inch long
when full grown, robust and greenish black. Its
back is decorated with tubercles.</p>
<p>Bright yellow blotches up to one-fourth inch
in diameter appear around the punctures produced
by the feeding of this insect.</p>
<p>The yellow aphids, <i>Monellia</i> spp., which attack
pecans inflict injury similar to that caused
by the black pecan aphid. However, the large
yellow blotches on the leaves do not result from
their feeding. A sticky substance called &ldquo;honeydew&rdquo;
is secreted by these insects creating an
ideal medium for sooty mold fungus to develop<a class="fn" id="fr_5" href="#fn_5">[5]</a>.</p>
<p>Both black and yellow aphids overwinter in
the egg stage in crevices in the bark. In the
spring the eggs hatch, and the aphids begin feeding
on the leaves. Many generations are completed
each year. Only females, which may be
wingless or winged, are produced during the
growing season. The winged individuals fly to
different parts of the tree or to other trees. In
the fall, males and females appear and eggs are
deposited under the bark.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig13">

</div>
<p>Usually, these insects are not present in sufficient
numbers to cause serious injury until mid
or late summer. Infestations earlier in the season
rarely assume damaging proportions. As is
the case with mites, aphid populations may increase,
following the application of certain insecticides
applied for the control of the pecan nut
casebearer or following treatment with bordeaux
mixture for pecan scab disease control.</p>

<img src="images/p06e.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="406" />
<p class="pcap">Figure 14. Southern green stink bug on developing nuts.</p>
</div>
<p><i>Control.</i>&mdash;When damaging infestations appear,
the trees should be sprayed with either 1
pound of 12 percent gamma BHC wettable powder;
or 1 pint of 40 percent nicotine sulfate plus
3 pounds of soap; or 1 pound of 25 percent parathion
wettable powder<a class="fn" href="#fn_9">[9]</a>.</p>
<h3 id="c25">MITES</h3>
<p>These tiny pests attack the leaves usually on
the underside causing irregular brown areas to
appear. Trees which are heavily infested appear
scorched and may lose their leaves in late summer
or fall.</p>
<p>Mites usually are light green and are just
large enough to be seen without the aid of a hand
lens. They are wingless and feed principally on
the underside of the leaves along the midrib. Colonies
of them produce webs in which molted skins
and eggs may be found. The life cycle of mites
is very short and several generations occur each
year. Large populations may develop during the
late summer and fall.</p>
<p>The use of certain insecticides for the control
of the pecan nut casebearer or bordeaux mixture
for scab control frequently contributes to increases
in mite populations later in the season.</p>
<p><i>Control.</i>&mdash;Mites may be controlled in three
ways when damaging infestations develop. An
application of 2 pounds of wettable sulfur per
100 gallons of water may be made; 6 pounds of
wettable sulfur per 100 gallons of water may be
added to the spray applied for the control of the
nut casebearer; and repeated applications of zineb
included in a regular spray schedule for pecan
scab control will effectively control mites. However,
a single application of zineb is not effective<a class="fn" id="fr_7" href="#fn_7">[7]</a>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<h3 id="c26">PECAN LEAF CASEBEARER</h3>
<p>On occasion, this insect, <i>Acrobasis juglandis</i>
(LeB.), develops to damaging numbers and causes
economic injury. Early in the spring the larva
feeds on unfolding leaves and buds. It may prevent
leaf development for weeks, resulting in a
greatly decreased yield of nuts.</p>
<p>The adult is a dark gray moth marked with
brown. Its forewings, which have a spread of
about two-thirds inch, are gray with black
blotches. There is a reddish mark near the base
of the forewings.</p>
<p>The immature larva is brown, but changes to
dark green as it develops to a length of one-half
inch. It has a shiny, brownish black head and is
enclosed in a gray case which completely covers
the body and is borne in a position nearly perpendicular
to the leaf on which the larva is feeding.</p>
<p>The pecan leaf casebearer overwinters as an
immature larva in a hibernaculum around a bud.
It emerges in late March or early April as the
buds open. The larvae mature in April, May and
June and transform into pupae within their gray
cases, <a href="#fig15">Figure 15</a>. The moths are present from
May until early August. Eggs are deposited during
this period on the underside of the leaves. The
larvae which hatch from these eggs develop slowly,
and do not attain a length of more than one-sixteenth
inch during that season. They construct
little winding cases in which they live.
Their feeding produces irregular blotches on the
leaf surface, <a href="#fig16">Figure 16</a>. Before the leaves drop
in the fall, the larvae migrate to the buds, and
construct their overwintering hibernacula. Only
one generation is completed each year.</p>
<p><i>Control.</i>&mdash;Control of this insect is accomplished
by spraying for the pecan nut casebearer.
See spray schedule, <a href="#Page_4">page 4</a>. The insecticides
recommended for nut casebearer control also reduce
infestations of the leaf casebearer.</p>

<h3 id="c27">PECAN PHYLLOXERA</h3>
<p>The pecan phylloxera, <i>Phylloxera devastatris</i>
Perg., and the pecan leaf phylloxera, <i>P. notabilis</i>
Perg., produce galls on the new growth of pecans.
Leaves, twigs and nuts may be affected.</p>
<p>The galls are conspicuous swellings, <a href="#fig17">Figure 17</a>,
which attain a size of from one-tenth to 1
inch in diameter. They are caused by a soft-bodied
insect which is closely related to aphids.</p>
<p>The winter is passed in the egg stage in crevices
in the bark. In the spring, the egg hatches
and the tiny nymph feeds on the tender, young
growth, apparently secreting a substance which
stimulates the plant tissues to develop into galls.</p>
<p>After the nymph reaches maturity, a number
of eggs are deposited inside the gall. The young
nymphs of the succeeding generation develop
within the gall, which splits open in 1 to 3 weeks,
liberating them. Several generations follow during
the summer and fall, as long as there is fresh
young growth on the tree. From 4 to 5 weeks
are required for each generation<a class="fn" id="fr_4" href="#fn_4">[4]</a>.</p>
<p><i>Control.</i>&mdash;The dormant oil spray recommended
for obscure scale control will prevent the development
of phylloxera. If dormant oil is not
applied, use 2 pints of nicotine sulfate plus 6
pounds of soap; 3 pounds of 25 percent malathion
wettable powder; or two and a half pounds of 10
percent gamma isomer BHC wettable powder per
100 gallons of water when the leaves are one-third
grown.</p>
<h3 id="c28">SAWFLIES</h3>
<p>Sawfly larvae, <i>Periclista</i> sp. and others, feed
on the foliage of pecans during April and early
May. The larvae, which are light green, chew
holes in the leaves. Usually the midrib and veins
are left intact, giving the leaflets a lacy appearance,
<a href="#fig18">Figure 18</a>.</p>
<p>The adults closely resemble wasps, except that
they are not &ldquo;wasp-waisted.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="c29">MAY BEETLES</h3>
<p>Many species of May beetles may damage pecans
early in the spring. The beetles appear only
at night and spend the day concealed beneath the
surface of the soil. They feed on the young leaves
and prevent the foliage from developing.</p>
<p>Beetles of the most common species are one-half
to three-fourths inch long and shiny dark
brown. They are attracted to lights and are observed
commonly on porches or screen doors at
night. The larvae are the grubworms, or white
grubs, which feed in the soil on the roots of many
plants.</p>
<p>The female beetle deposits eggs in the soil,
where the larva develops. Most species require
two summers for the larva to mature. Pupation
is accomplished in a cell which is constructed in
the ground in the fall of the second year. The
beetles emerge the following spring. Both larvae
and adults may be found in the soil during the
winter.</p>
<p><i>Control.</i>&mdash;May beetles are usually a problem
in orchards which are not cultivated because the
larvae feed on the roots of the sod cover. Cultivation
of the orchard periodically will reduce the
food supply of the grubs, and smaller infestations
of adults will appear the following year. Where
cultivation is not feasible, sprays will control the
adults. Apply 2 pounds of 50 percent DDT wettable
powder; 4 pounds of lead arsenate; or 1
pound of 25 percent parathion wettable powder
per 100 gallons of water when damage by this insect
is severe<a class="fn" href="#fn_9">[9]</a>.</p>
<h3 id="c30">PECAN CIGAR CASEBEARER</h3>
<p>The pecan cigar casebearer, <i>Coleophora caryaefoliella</i>
(Clem), may be damaging in some
years. The larva feeds on the leaves, producing
tiny holes. It constructs a light brown, cigar-shaped
case about one-fourth inch in length
which encases it throughout development.</p>
<p><i>Control.</i>&mdash;The spray applied for control of the
nut casebearer will usually prevent significant
injury by the cigar casebearer. See spray schedule,
<a href="#Page_4">page 4</a>.</p>
<h3 id="c31">FALL WEBWORM</h3>
<p>The webs produced by the fall webworm, <i>Hyphantria
cunea</i> (Drury), are familiar to everyone.
Leaves are eaten by the larvae which live in
loosely woven, dirty white webs, <a href="#fig19">Figure 19</a>.</p>
<p>The adult is a white moth which may have
black or brown spots on the forewing. Its wings
have a span of about 1 inch.</p>
<p>The larvae are pale yellow spotted with black.
They attain a length of 1 inch when full grown
and are covered with long black and white hairs.</p>
<p>The insect overwinters as a pupa in lightly
woven cocoons in debris on the soil or under the
bark. In the spring the adults emerge and lay
masses of greenish white eggs on the leaves. The
caterpillars which hatch from the eggs feed on
the leaves in colonies under webs which they construct.
After feeding for a month to 6 weeks, the
larvae crawl down the tree and pupate in loose
cocoons in debris, under bark, or in loose soil.
Adults appear during the summer and deposit
eggs for the second generation. The larvae of
this generation feed extensively until fall, crawl
down the tree and pupate for the winter.</p>
<p><i>Control.</i>&mdash;Light infestations on a few trees
can be eliminated by pruning out the affected
branches and burning them. If this method of
control is not practicable, the trees should be
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
sprayed with 2 pounds of 50 percent DDT wettable
powder; 1 pound of 25 percent parathion
wettable powder; or 3 pounds of lead arsenate
per 100 gallons of water<a class="fn" href="#fn_9">[9]</a>.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig19">
<img src="images/p08.jpg" alt="" width="554" height="500" />
<p class="pcap">Figure 19. Web of the fall webworm on a pecan limb.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="c32">WALNUT CATERPILLAR</h3>
<p>During the spring and summer, the walnut
caterpillars, <i>Datana integerrima</i> G. &amp; R. and
others, may strip the leaves from branches or
entire small trees. The adult is a moth with a
wingspan of 1&frac12; to 2 inches. The forewings are
light brown with darker wavy lines. The hindwings
are lighter in color without lines.</p>
<p>The immature larva is reddish brown with
narrow yellowish lines that extend the length of
the body. The full-grown larva is almost black
with two grayish lines on the back and two on
the sides. Many long, soft gray hairs are distributed
over the body.</p>
<p>This insect overwinters in the pupal stage in
the soil. The adult emerges in the spring and
deposits eggs in masses on the underside of the
leaves, <a href="#fig20">Figure 20</a>. The larvae feed in colonies on
the leaves for about 3 weeks. At periodic intervals,
the groups of larvae move to the trunk to
molt and, after shedding their skins, they return
to the leaves to feed until the next molt. They do
not encase themselves in webs. There are two
generations each year, the first appearing in late
spring and early summer, the second in later summer
and fall. Larvae of the second generation
complete development and crawl down to pupate
in the soil.</p>
<p><i>Control.</i>&mdash;When these insects become abundant
enough to defoliate portions of the tree, they
may be controlled by applying a spray containing
2 pounds of 50 percent DDT wettable powder; 3
pounds of lead arsenate; or 1 pound of 25 percent
parathion wettable powder per 100 gallons
of water.</p>

<p class="pcap">Figure 20. Walnut caterpillar adults and egg mass on

</div>
<h3 id="c33">PECAN CATOCALA</h3>
<p>Several species of catocalas, <a href="#fig21">Figure 21</a>, among
them <i>Catocala maestosa</i> Hlst., may strip the
leaves of pecans in the spring leaving only the
midribs. The caterpillars are very dark gray and
attain a length of about 3 inches when full grown.
They are very active when disturbed and move
with a looping motion. Both the caterpillars and
the moths are well camouflaged. When they rest
on the trees during the day, their color so harmonizes
with the color of the bark that they are
frequently indistinguishable.</p>
<p><i>Control.</i>&mdash;One application of 2 pounds of 50
percent DDT wettable powder per 100 gallons of
water controls this pest. Although the majority
of catocala larvae reach maturity before the time
to spray for the nut casebearer, a number of them
will be killed when the recommended spray is applied
for the latter insect.</p>
<h3 id="c34">PECAN SPITTLEBUG</h3>
<p>In the spring and early summer a number of
buds and small nuts may be covered with foamy
white masses. Inside these masses are several
small insects called spittlebugs, <i>Clastoptera obtusa</i>
(Say). The white froth is produced probably
to maintain an artificial high humidity,
which is required for development. The adults
resemble leafhoppers and fly actively during the
summer.</p>
<p>This insect has not been known to cause any
significant injury on pecans in Texas.</p>
<h3 id="c35">PECAN BUD MOTH</h3>
<p>The pecan bud moth, <i>Gretchena bolliana</i>
(Sling.), damages nursery stock and freshly top-worked
pecans. The greenish larvae feed in the
axils of the newly set buds and in the terminals
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
of young trees, causing extensive branching.
There are several generations each year.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig21">
<img src="images/p08c.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="368" />
<p class="pcap">Figure 21. Moth of the pecan catocala.</p>
</div>
<p><i>Control.</i>&mdash;This insect may be controlled by
applying a spray containing 2 pounds of 50 percent
DDT wettable powder per 100 gallons of
water.</p>
<h3 id="c36">TWIG GIRDLER</h3>
<p>The adult twig girdler, <i>Oncideres cingulata</i>
(Say) (<i>O. texana</i> of some authors), girdles twigs
and branches, weakening them so that they fall
off or die on the tree, <a href="#fig22">Figure 22</a>. This insect is
active during the late summer and early fall.
Many twigs may be found on the ground under
a severely infested tree. Secondary branching
may occur and the number of bearing twigs is
reduced.</p>
<p>The twig borer is a grayish brown beetle one-half
to five-eighths inch in length with a broad
gray band over the middle of the wing covers.
Its head is reddish brown and bears a pair of
long antennae, which extend beyond the abdomen
on the male.</p>
<p>The larva is a white legless grub about three-fourths
inch long when it reaches maturity.</p>
<p>This insect overwinters as a partially grown
larva in a twig on the tree or ground. It develops
rapidly in the spring feeding in the twig.
Following pupation, the adult emerges in late
August or early September. The female systematically
girdles twigs and deposits eggs in the
severed portion since the larva is unable to develop
in healthy sapwood. The eggs hatch in a
few weeks into larvae which remain small until
the following spring when they complete development,
pupate and emerge as adults in the late
summer and fall. There is one generation annually,
although some individuals require 2 years
to mature<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a>.</p>
<p><i>Control.</i>&mdash;Infestations may be reduced by removing
girdled branches from the trees and the
ground and burning them.</p>
<p>Chemical control is also effective. The trees
should be sprayed with 4 pounds of 50 percent
DDT wettable powder per 100 gallons of water
when the first injured branches are observed in
late August or early September. Two or three
applications at 2-week intervals may be required
for most effective control<a class="fn" href="#fn_9">[9]</a>.</p>
<h3 id="c37">RED-SHOULDERED SHOT-HOLE BORER</h3>
<p>The red-shouldered shot-hole borer, <i>Xylobiops
basilare</i> (Say), and other shot-hole borers also
injure trees in a devitalized condition. The larvae
feed in wood, pupate and emerge as adults
through round holes about one-eighth inch in diameter
in the bark. Many of these holes may be
observed in close proximity to each other.</p>
<p><i>Control.</i>&mdash;Since this insect feeds on dying or
dead wood, prunings and dead limbs should be
removed from the orchard and burned.</p>
<p>Adequate fertilizer and water will keep trees
in a healthy condition and prevent injury by this
pest.</p>
<h3 id="c38">FLATHEADED BORERS</h3>
<p>The flatheaded apple tree borer, <i>Chrysobothris
femorata</i> (Oliv.), and other species of flatheaded
borers attack unhealthy or recently transplanted
pecan trees by burrowing in the bark and sapwood
of the large branches and trunk. Their
presence is indicated by the appearance of darkened,
depressed areas in the bark from which
traces of frass may protrude. When these portions
of the bark are removed, shallow winding
burrows packed with sawdust may be observed.
The burrows usually are on the sunny side of the
trunk or branch, but may extend completely
around and penetrate the wood to a depth of 2
inches. Young trees may be girdled by this insect.</p>
<p>The adult beetle is about one-half inch long,
broad and blunt at the head end and tapering to
a point posteriorly. Its wing covers, which have
a metallic sheen, are dark colored and corrugated.</p>
<p>The larva, or borer, which is legless and yellowish
white, attains a length of 1&frac14; inches when
full grown. Immediately behind the head is a
broad, flattened expanded area from which the
insect takes its name.</p>
<p>The winter is passed by larvae in varying
stages of development within the tree. In the
spring, they change to pupae in their burrows,
emerging as adults during the spring and summer.
The female beetles deposit their eggs in
cracks or bruises in the bark. The larvae which
hatch from these eggs feed during the remainder
of the season and pass the winter. There is only
one generation each year.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<div class="img" id="fig22">
<img src="images/p09.jpg" alt="" width="405" height="500" />
<p class="pcap">Figure 22. Adult twig
girdler and characteristic
injury to twig.</p>
</div>
<p><i>Control.</i>&mdash;The beetles are attracted to trees or
areas of trees in a devitalized condition, induced
by transplanting, drouth, sunscald, bruises or
poor growing conditions. The trees must be kept
in a healthy, vigorous condition by proper fertilization
and watering. On young or transplanted
trees, wrapping the trunks in early spring before
the adults appear is the only effective control
known for these insects. Injury can be prevented
by thoroughly wrapping the entire trunk from
ground level to the branches with heavy paper or
other wrapping material. The wrapping should
be tied securely with twine and should be maintained
on the tree for 2 years. Regular observations
should be made to see that the twine does
not girdle the tree.</p>
<p>In older trees, the borers can be removed with
a sharp knife. Care should be taken to injure as
little of the healthy wood as possible. If the
wound is extensive, it should be trimmed and then
painted with a commercial tree paint or with a
mixture of one part creosote and three parts coal
tar. Dead and dying limbs and trees should be
removed from the orchard each year and burned
before the following spring. If they are not
burned, the borers in them may mature and re-infest
surrounding trees. Commercial tree borer
preparations are of little value in controlling this
insect.</p>
<h3 id="c39">OBSCURE SCALE</h3>
<p>The obscure scale, <i>Chrysomphalus obscurus</i>
(Comst.), is a pest of considerable importance,
particularly in the more arid portions of the
State. The tiny insect under its scale covering
sucks the sap from the limbs and branches, causing
them to lose their leaves and die back from
the tips. The tree is so devitalized by the feeding
of this insect that it is made vulnerable to
attack by wood borers.</p>
<p>The scale covering over a full-grown female
is about one-eighth inch long and is usually dark
gray, and closely resembles the bark of the tree.
Infested limbs appear to have had wood ashes
sprinkled over them, <a href="#fig23">Figure 23</a>. Numerous pits
appear in the bark where the insects feed, producing
a roughened appearance.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig23">
<img src="images/p09a.jpg" alt="" width="492" height="500" />
<p class="pcap">Figure 23. Severe infestation of obscure scale on a pecan twig.</p>
</div>
<p>The winter is passed by the female scales under
their coverings on the bark. Eggs laid in the
spring hatch into tiny, salmon-colored crawlers
which move about for a short time, then settle
down and insert their beaks. While they are
feeding, a scale covering develops which is made
up of secreted wax and cast skins.</p>
<p>The females never move again from the spot
they have selected, but the adult males develop
wings and emerge from their scale coverings to
mate with the females. Only one generation is
produced each year.</p>
<p><i>Control.</i>&mdash;When damaging populations develop,
a spray application of 3&frac12; gallons of 97
percent miscible dormant oil per 100 gallons of
water during the dormant season will keep this
pest under control.</p>
<h2 id="c40"><span class="small"><i>Application of Fungicides and Insecticides</i></span></h2>
<p>When possible, fungicides for disease control
and insecticides for insect control should be combined
in the spray tank and applied to the trees
in one operation. The spray materials should be
applied evenly and thoroughly to all the leaf and
nut surfaces to provide a chemical barrier to disease
organisms and insects. Do not neglect the
tops of the trees. Diseases and insects can harbor
and multiply in all unsprayed areas of the
tree.</p>
<p>Thorough coverage with spray materials is
essential for effective control. As a guideline,
apply approximately 1 gallon of spray mixture
for each foot of tree height. Apply 20 gallons to
a 20-foot tree and 40 gallons to a 40-foot tree,
etc.</p>
<h2 id="c41"><span class="small"><i>Spray Equipment</i></span></h2>
<p>Various types of spray machines for application
of fungicides and insecticides to pecan
trees are available. The spray machines employ
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
either a high pressure hydraulic pump, high
pressure centrifugal pump or low pressure high
air velocity systems. All the machines are portable
and are equipped with a gasoline engine or
operate from a truck or tractor power takeoff
shaft.</p>
<p>For pecan spraying, a tank having a minimum
capacity of 300 gallons is desirable. The pump
should deliver 20 to 30 gallons per minute and
maintain a pressure of 400 to 600 pounds per
square inch while operating. A spray gun which
is adjustable to produce a mist spray for spraying
small trees or the lower canopy of large trees
and a narrow stream that will reach the tops of
tall trees is essential.</p>
<p>For safety and durability high pressure rubber
hose having an inside diameter of three-fourths
inch should be used with all high pressure
spray machines.</p>

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a

by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
